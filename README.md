# Book Recommendations from Charles Darwin
Build a book recommendation system using NLP and the text of books like "On the Origin of Species".

# Description
Recommendation systems are at the heart of many products such as Netflix or Amazon. They generally rely on metadata (e.g., the actors or director of a movie) or on user tastes (e.g., the movies you liked before) to determine which you are most likely to enjoy. But when you are working with text-heavy datasets, you have access to a much richer resourceâ€”the whole text! In this project, you will learn how to build the basis of a book recommendation system based on their content. You will use Charles Darwin's bibliography to find out which books might interest you.

The dataset was manually collected from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

# Tasks:
1. Darwin's bibliography
2. Load the contents of each book into Python
3. Find "On the Origin of Species"
4. Tokenize the corpus
5. Stemming of the tokenized corpus
6. Building a bag-of-words model
7. The most common words of a given book
8. Build a tf-idf model
9. The results of the tf-idf model
10. Compute distance between texts
11. The book most similar to "On the Origin of Species"
12. Which books have similar content?
